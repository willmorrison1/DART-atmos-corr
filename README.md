# DART-atmos-corr
A place for code and tutorials for atmospheric correction of longwave infrared camera imagery using the [Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART)](http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/us/dart.html) model.

This repository will be updated with [tutorials](tutorials) and more [code](code) to give potential users a hands-on guide to using the methods outlined in Morrison *et al.* (2019) (in press).

A software package has been developed to work with DART outputs: [daRt for the R programming language](https://github.com/willmorrison1/daRt) and complements the atmospheric correction processing and analysis. daRt methods are being developed to simplify the atmospheric correction process.
