# DART-atmos-corr
A place for code and tutorials for atmospheric correction of longwave infrared camera imagery using the [Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART)](http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/us/dart.html) model.

This repository is being constantly updated with [tutorials](tutorials) and [code](code) to give readers of Morrison *et al.* (2019) (in press) a hands-on guide to performing atmospheric and emissivity corrections for longwave infrared camera imagery across complex terrain.

A software package has been developed to work with DART outputs: [daRt for the R programming language](https://github.com/willmorrison1/daRt) and complements the atmospheric correction processing and analysis. daRt methods are being developed to simplify the atmospheric correction process.
