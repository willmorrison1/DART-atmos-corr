# DART-atmos-corr
A place for code and tutorials for atmospheric correction of longwave infrared camera imagery using the [Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART)](http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/us/dart.html) model.

This repository is being constantly updated with [tutorials](tutorials) and [code](code) to give readers of Morrison *et al.* (2019) (in press) a hands-on guide to performing atmospheric and emissivity corrections for longwave infrared camera imagery across complex terrain.

*DART "Scene 3D" view of central London area (430 m x 430 m) used for testing of DART atmospheric correction.*

A software package has been developed to work with DART outputs: [daRt for the R programming language](https://github.com/willmorrison1/daRt) and complements the atmospheric correction processing and analysis. daRt methods are being developed to simplify the atmospheric correction process. 

## Summary of atmospheric correction routine 

1. [**Real world images**](https://github.com/willmorrison1/DART-atmos-corr/tree/master/tutorials/London/DARTsimulation). 
Defines the types of 'real world' images that are suitable for correction using this technique
2. [**Model world**](https://github.com/willmorrison1/DART-atmos-corr/tree/master/tutorials/London/DARTsimulation). 
 Configure a three-dimensional model world to faciliate the correction.
3. [**Create multi line of sight image**](https://github.com/willmorrison1/DART-atmos-corr/tree/master/tutorials/London/DARTsimulation). 
 Optional. Create multi line of sight (MLOS) image with per-pixel path lengths between the surface and camera.
4. [**DART atmosphere simulation**](https://github.com/willmorrison1/DART-atmos-corr/tree/master/tutorials/London/DARTsimulation). 
 Configure and run DART for simulation of atmospheric effects.
5. [**DART image post-processing**](https://github.com/willmorrison1/DART-atmos-corr/tree/master/tutorials/London/DARTsimulation). 
 Optional. Process the MLOS image mask with the DART-processed images.
6. [**Band calculation and correction**](https://github.com/willmorrison1/DART-atmos-corr/tree/master/tutorials/London/DARTsimulation). 
 Correct the real world images using the simulated images.
7. [**Image analysis**](https://github.com/willmorrison1/DART-atmos-corr/tree/master/tutorials/London/DARTsimulation). Perform some simple analysis on processed images.
