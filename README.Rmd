# DART-atmos-corr
A place for code and tutorials for atmospheric correction of longwave infrared camera imagery using the [Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART)](http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/us/dart.html) model.

This repository is being constantly updated with [tutorials](tutorials) and [code](code) to give readers of Morrison *et al.* (2019) (in press) a hands-on guide to performing atmospheric and emissivity corrections for longwave infrared camera imagery across complex terrain.

## Summary of atmospheric correction routine 
The overall routine is summarised in the below flowchart. Click on a flowchart element to be directed to the appropriate documentation (WIP).

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)
diagramOut <- DiagrammeR::mermaid('
graph TB
            A(Real world image)-->B(Configure Blender model world)
            B-->C(Create multi line of sight image)
            B-->D(Run DART atmosphere simulation)
            C-->E
            D-->E
            E(Post process images)-->F(Band calculation and correction)
            A-->F
            F-->G(Analysis)')

```

A software package has been developed to work with DART outputs: [daRt for the R programming language](https://github.com/willmorrison1/daRt) and complements the atmospheric correction processing and analysis. daRt methods are being developed to simplify the atmospheric correction process.
